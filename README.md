# Bike sharing Linear regression assignment
> We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information of the project
- BoomBike company aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits. 
- We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables.
- Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset ('day') on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.


## Conclusions of the analysis
### The top 3 predictor variables that influences the bike booking are :-
- apparent temperature (atemp) variable has a coefficient value of ‘0.5616’ indicating that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.5616 units.
- Year (yr) has a coefficient value of ‘0.2294’ indicating that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.2294 units.
- Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) has a coefficient value of ‘-0.2279’ indicating that a unit increase in Weathersit_3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.2279 units.
